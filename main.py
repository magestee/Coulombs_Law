## electric charge is q = ne where n is an integer.
""" and e = -1.6 * 10**-19 c """
## matter with alike charges repell each other and matter with different charges attract eachother.
## so how can we predict how strong the foces between them are going to be?
## coulumb law is:
""" f = k*q1*q2 / r**2 """
""" ke = 8.98 * 10**9 """

#### FIRST: WE NEED A CALCULATOR FOR COILOMBS LAW ####
